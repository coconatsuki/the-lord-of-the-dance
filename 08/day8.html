          <p class="section-text">
            At the summit of the Mountains of Melody, Jimli finds himself
            standing before an ancient shrine, where stone tablets are inscribed
            with intricate musical notes and dance patterns. The shrine hums
            with a low, resonant melody, and Jimli can sense the wisdom of ages
            past in the air around him.
          </p>

          />
          <p class="section-text">
            Just as he's about to walk past it, the ground beneath his feet
            trembles slightly, and the melody from the shrine intensifies,
            blocking the path forward. "Well, that's just rude," Jimli grumbles.
            "I came to dance, not to read! But if I must, let's see if these
            elves knew their jigs from their jags."

          />
          <p class="section-text">
            It quickly becomes clear that the shrine is more than just a
            monument; it's a test! The ancient spirits that dwell here won't let
            him pass until he's proven himself worthy by demonstrating his
            understanding of the melodies inscribed on the tablets.

          <p class="section-text">
            Jimli squints at the inscriptions, trying to make sense of the
            ancient knowledge. "These stone-faced spirits better appreciate the
            effort," he mutters, scratching his beard, "because I'm about to
            give them the best crash course in dwarven determination they've
            ever seen."<br />
            With a determined glint in his eye, Jimli begins to decipher the
            ancient melodies, knowing that mastering this knowledge is key to
            unlocking the path forward.
