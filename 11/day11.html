          Jimli's heart thumps louder than a dwarven war drum as he barrels down
          the winding path. Each step is a reminder of the endless mountains
          he's scaled, the biting cold he's survived, and that blasted elf at
          the gate who nearly ruined it all. But now, the real race begins! The
          elven 'Mix and Match' contest —the one Jimli's dreamed of winning
          since he could dance on two sturdy feet— is just within his grasp.<br /><br />If
          he doesn't make it in time, all those days of hardship will have been
          for nothing. His breath comes in ragged gasps, sweat dripping down his
          brow, but there's no turning back now. “Keep it together, Jimli,” he
          mutters to himself. The festival awaits, and no elf, bird, or twig is
          going to stop him now. The path stretches on, the ticking clock in his
          mind growing louder, but his stubborn dwarven spirit refuses to
          falter. This is his moment. And by the beard of his ancestors, he
          won't be distracted —not now!
