          The grand moment has arrived. As the sun sets, casting a golden hue
          over the festival grounds, the festival's organizers announce the
          start of the contest. The elves who aren't participating form a wide
          circle, their excited murmurs dying down as the jury take their seats
          at the edge of the area. Jimli's heart races as the participants are
          asked to step forward. <br /><br />
          This is it, the moment Jimli has dreamed of! With three songs to
          impress the judges, the stakes couldn't be higher. Each song will test
          the dancers' skill, connection, and style, starting with a slow rhythm
          that will gradually speed up to a dizzying pace. Jimli glances at his
          partner, the graceful Elowen, who meets his gaze with a reassuring
          smile. "Win or lose," he mutters to himself, "I'll still be the
          best-dressed dwarf here â€”and the only one with enough sense to bring a
          keg!" The humor in his words steadies his nerves, but deep down, he
          knows this is his moment. The music begins, and with it, the first
          test of his abilities.
