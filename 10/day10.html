            After what felt like an eternity, Jimli finally descends into the
            Valley of Steps. The biting cold of the mountains is behind him. The
            ground beneath his boots no longer crunches with snow but feels
            unsettlingly soft, almost too perfect.The trees here are tall and
            elegant, their leaves whispering in a language Jimli doesn't
            understand.<br /><br />The whole place reeks of elves.

          <p class="section-text">
            "Bah, what kind of place is this? Not a single decent stone to kick.
            Feels like I'm walkin' on fancy cake." Jimli mutters to himself as
            he presses forward, alert to the strange noises echoing from the
            surrounding forest. Birds? No, something... else. The sound of
            delicate chimes floats on the breeze, along with a scent that's
            suspiciously... floral.<br /><br />Finally, he sees it — Standing in
            front of a massive stone portal is an elf. Tall, slender, and
            annoyingly smug.

          />
          <p class="section-text">
            "Ah, a dwarf. How quaint," the elf sneers, looking down at Jimli as
            if he were something scraped off his boot. "I see the legends of
            your kind's persistence aren't exaggerated. But I'm afraid
            persistence alone won't get you through this gate."<br /><br />Jimli
            snorts. "And what, pray tell, will get me through, pointy-ears?" The
            elf straightens, flicking his long hair behind his shoulder with an
            air of practiced superiority. "Only those who can master the
            graceful Dance of Arrows may pass," he says, gesturing to the ground
            in front of the portal.

          <p class="section-text">
            Intricate patterns of arrows are carved into the stone, glowing
            faintly. Jimli glares, his fists clenching at his sides. "Grace...
            bah! Who needs that? I've got rhythm where it counts!" The elf
            chuckles softly, clearly unconvinced. "We shall see, dwarf. But
            don't be too disheartened when you fail —few outsiders, if any, have
            ever succeeded."<br /><br />"Well, make some room in yer elvish
            history books," Jimli mutters. With that, he plants his feet on the
            first glowing arrow, preparing to follow the rhythm.
